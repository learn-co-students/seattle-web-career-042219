# Gaps
Write a function called `gaps` that accepts an array of integers, and an
integer `N`. The function should return a new array of integers `0 <= i <= N`
that are missing from the original array.


## Sample Input
```
numbers = [0, 1, 3, 5]
N = 5
```

```
output = [2, 4]
```

```
numbers = [4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
N = 5
```

```
output = [0, 3, 5]
```

```
numbers = []
N = 8
```

```
output = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```
