# TIPS: Cycle Detection Practice + Introducing Stacks & Queues

## SWBATs

 - [x] Explain the difference between a linear and a non-linear data structure
   - Arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues are linear
   - Trees and graphs are non-linear
 - [x] Write code to detect whether a "linked list" contains a cycle
 - [x] Understand the basics of stacks and queues
   - A stack is like a stack of plates, last in first out (LIFO)
   - A queue is like a line, first in first out (FIFO)
   - A nice feature of stacks + queues is that `push` and `pop` are both O(1) operations
   - You can use a regular array like a stack or queue (e.g. for a breadth-first traversal), it just won't be as efficient as an actual queue data structure
