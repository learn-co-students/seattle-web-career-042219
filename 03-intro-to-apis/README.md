# APIs, or "Hashes + the Internet"

## SWBATs

### How the Internet Works
 - [] Recognize the parts of the request-response lifecycle
 - [] Define client and describe setting up the request
 - [] Define server and describe how the response is formatted
 - [] Identify HTML as a response type
 - [] Identify and define JSON

### Ruby Fundamentals
 - [] Understand what a "gem" is, and how to use them
 - [] Explain how missing keys lead to `undefined method ... for nil:NilClass`

### APIs
 - [] Define Application Programming Interface (API)
 - [] Explain the uses of an API on the internet
 - [] Explain the difference between using an API and scraping
 - [] Practice making requests to an API and parsing and examining the result
 - [] Practice writing a command line application (CLI)

## Deliverables
 - [] Use the `rest-client` gem to make a request to the Google Books API with the query "ruby programming"
 - [] Parse the response to find the title, author, and description of each book
 - [] Convert the hard-coded query into an interactive CLI query
