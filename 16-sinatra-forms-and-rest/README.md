# Goals
- Sinatra is a DSL, sits on top of Ruby and Rack to give us extra functionality and abstraction
  - Domain Specific Language
    - Not as general as Ruby, more web specific.

- Define 'convention over configuration'
- Implement one model that inherit from ActiveRecord
- Implement one controller to route and process requests
