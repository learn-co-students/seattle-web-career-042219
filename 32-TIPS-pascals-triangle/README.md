# TIPS: Pascal's Triangle

Given a row number, write a function that prints out the values from that row of Pascal's Triangle

For example,

`triangle(0)` should print out 1

`triangle(4)` should print out 1, 4, 6, 4, 1

`triangle(10)` should print out 1, 10, 45, 120, 210, 252, 210, 120, 45, 10, 1

You can use Ruby or JavaScript (`print` or `puts` in Ruby, `console.log` in JavaScript)
