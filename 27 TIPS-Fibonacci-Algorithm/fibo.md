#- Fibonacci Sequence

```
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
```

`1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34`

###- Return the value at a given index

`fibo(7) =>13`

###- Using a loop do

###- Using an until loop

###- Using a .times do loop

###- Display the numbers up to an index

`fibo(7) =>[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]`

###- Calculate phi to n iterations

###- Calculate up to how many iterations are needed to approximate phi to 10 digits.
