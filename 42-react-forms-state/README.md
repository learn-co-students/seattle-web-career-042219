This lecture had two examples. One for the plain old vanilla Javascript. One  for the React version.

The React version has two commits. One for the initial commit. This is just the result of "create-react-app" The second is the updated code that is the final app.

The difference is here: https://github.com/learn-co-students/seattle-web-career-042219/commit/a42233c177abf87952a315d8d98878d946e656fe

Please note: This app includes Bootstrap as well. It comes from this CDN:     <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"
    />

This is NOT included in create-react-app. I added it later.
